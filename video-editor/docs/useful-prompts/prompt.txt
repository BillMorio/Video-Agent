Now we also need to add a 'pop up' modal that is specific to a particular card... This is because we need to click on a specific card, and have some abilities to edit the content on that card. A-rolls will be coming from and AI-avatar creation API... as such, we should have the ability to like trim/fit the 'video' generated, for the images card we should have the ability to 'generate' or 'edit images' using AI models such as  nano-banana pro edit, also since each graphic/scene has a 'designated' time on screen, we should have the ability to turn an image into a video and like zoom it slowly(we will be using an ffmpeg api for this)... Now for the b-roll card... since most of the b-roll footage will be coming from free stock footage api's like pexels, we should have the ability to like have controls to trim/fit the footage to fit the apportioned time, we can also have the ability to generate new b-roll... Now, for the the motion graphics part, we should have the ability to choose if we are going to generate motions graphics with Hera AI API, or Veo 3.1... For Hera AI api its just a prompt and the ability to to like add a reference image to guide the prompt and the duration for the generated motion graphics... For generating motion Graphics with Veo 3.1, we need to input two images, one for as a start image and another as an end image... Then add time duratoin and a prompt is generates a video of 8 sec maximum. Now we need the UI for controlling the outputs for this different cards. Does that make sense???
